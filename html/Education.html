            <p class="alignLeft">
                My time at BYU and in high school has included relevant education and experience in the following areas:
            </p>
            <p class="alignLeft">
                <em>Computer Science and Information Systems: </em>Before college, I built a foundation
                of knowledge of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, Python, and C#, web development
                in HTML and CSS, and game development with Unity game engine. As a freshman and sophomore in
                 college, I built on that foundation by diving deeper into HTML and CSS and learning the 
                 basics of C++, Microsoft VBA, SQL, and Tableau. Projects demonstrating my capabilities in these 
                 areas are included on the <a href="./Projects.html" style="color:#DB8C92">Personal Projects</a> page.
                 <br> As a junior in the core of the Information Systems program at the Marriott School of
                 Business, I broadened and deepend by programming skillset and knowledge base as I explored 
                 more JavaScript tools (including Node.js and Express.js), univariate and bivariate 
                 data analysis and visualization using python, and Full-Stack Programming using ASP.NET Core MVC / C#.
                 I was also fascinated with principles of cloud computing as my classes provided hands-on
                 experience with TCP/IP networking, AWS (EC2, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk), file management with Linux commands, 
                 and encryption/decryption


            </p>
            <p class="alignLeft">
                <em>Business: </em>At BYU, I've been instructed in the basics of business principles such as
                accounting, supply chain management, statistics, marketing etc. Part of this training included planning
                and executing a full <a href="./Projects.html" style="color:#DB8C92">mock advertising 
                campaign</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="alignLeft">
                I graduated high school with a 3.98 GPA, several AP credits, and a 33 score on the ACT, in the 
                top 2% of scores nationwide. I've maintained a 3.8 GPA throughout college, including straight As
                in all information systems and computer science-related classes.

            <p class="alignLeft">
                <em>Association of Information Systems: </em> My membership in AIS at BYU included attending
                many events, including information sessions, networking opportunities, and training events.
                I plan to continue as an active member of AIS throughout the rest of my college education.

            <p class="alignLeft padBottom">
                <em>Marketing Association: </em> As a member of the Marketing Association during my freshman
                year of college, I attended events including information sessions and masterclasses in digital
                marketing, brand strategy, search engine optimization, etc.
