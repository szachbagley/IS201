    <p class="pageBodyText padLeft">The mission of Brigham Young 
        University — founded, supported, and guided by The Church
         of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist 
         individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal 
         life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive 
         learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to
          excellence is expected and the full realization of human
           potential is pursued. <br> <br>BYU seeks to develop students of 
           faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the 
           desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout 
           their lives. These are the common aims of all education at
            BYU. Both those who teach in the classroom and those who 
            direct activities outside the classroom are responsible for 
            contributing to this complete educational vision. A BYU 
            education should be:
          <ul>
              <li>Spiritually Strengthening</li>
              <li>Intellectually Enlarging</li>
              <li>Character Building</li>
              <li>Leading to Lifelong Learning and Service</li>
          </ul>
